# keybinding crate

Placeholder crate - will be used for a cross backend keybinding library allowing for configuration
of keybindings for command line apps that support Crossterm, Termion, Termwiz (and potentially GUI
frameworks if there is interest).

See <https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/discussions/627> for some background.
